# ATREX

ATREX is a lightweight package for hardware-specific GPU operators. Operators
are integrated through one consistent review and validation workflow.

## Repository layout

```text
python/atrex/                              Public APIs and dispatch
src/<vendor>/<operator>/<arch>/            Target-specific implementations
src/<vendor>/<operator>/common_utils/      Proven cross-architecture helpers
op_test/<vendor>/<operator>/test_<operator>_<arch>.py
                                           Target-specific functional tests
.agents/skills/atrex-kernel-integration/   Integration workflow
```

Directory placement follows the implementation target, not its language.
Public APIs belong in `python/atrex/api/` and are lazily exported from
`python/atrex/__init__.py`. When implementations share an API, dispatch uses
the detected runtime, architecture, version, and call-specific eligibility.

## Test gate

An operator change is incomplete unless its matching target test is added or
updated in the same change. The current files are:

```text
op_test/nvidia/chunk_gdn/test_chunk_gdn_sm120.py
```

All applicable tests must pass on their target hardware before the operator is
accepted. See the
[`atrex-kernel-integration`](.agents/skills/atrex-kernel-integration/SKILL.md)
skill for the full placement, API, dispatch, compilation, kernel-name, and
validation requirements.

## Build

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
./build.sh
```

`build.sh` writes the wheel to `dist/` and force-reinstalls it into the same
Python environment used for the build. Set `PYTHON=/path/to/python` to select a
different environment.
